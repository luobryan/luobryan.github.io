                I'm currently a freshman pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 
                I have strong interests in both front-end design and web/mobile development. I'm also interested in using computational
                models to gain insight into the world around us. 
                <br/>
                In my free time I enjoy hiking, exploring nature, photography, playing various instruments, and watching TV.
